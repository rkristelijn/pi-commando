# pi-commando
Going full commando on my Raspberry Pi, Raspbian Lite (commandline) and try to do all from there... just because I'm curious if I can...

# Install Raspbian Lite

# Things I want to do

- Fullstack JavaScript development (probably using vim)
- Surf the web (lynx? or something with JavaScript support)
- Read and respond to my e-mail
- Do my admin
