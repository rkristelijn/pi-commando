Going full commando on my Raspberry Pi, Raspbian Lite (commandline) and try to do all from there... just because I'm curious if I can...

# Install Raspbian Lite

After installing a clean Raspbian Lite image using Noobs installer (I don't have to do anything with Wifi, because I'm connected to LAN), I'm doing the `apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade` commands.

I've already set the language to US and also the keyboard layout to US in Noobs, but probably the first things you should do after installing a fresh Raspbian is:

- Update/Upgrade
- Set up security
- Localize (Timezone, Language, Keyboard)

# Security

See [the documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/security.md)

- Disable raspbian user
- Create new User

# Things I want to do

- Fullstack JavaScript development (probably using vim)
- Surf the web (lynx? or something with JavaScript support)
- Read and respond to my e-mail
- Do my admin
